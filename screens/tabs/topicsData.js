      theory: `Parts of speech are categories of words based on their function in a sentence.\n
      Noun – Names a person, place, thing, or idea (e.g., John, city, happiness).\n
      Pronoun – Replaces a noun (e.g., he, she, it, they).\n
      Adjective – Describes a noun (e.g., beautiful, tall, happy).\n
      Verb – Shows action or state (e.g., run, is, write).\n
      Adverb – Modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb (e.g., quickly, very, well).\n
      Preposition – Shows a relationship between words (e.g., in, on, under, between).\n
      Conjunction – Connects words, phrases, or clauses (e.g., and, but, because).\n
      Interjection – Expresses emotion (e.g., Wow!, Ouch!).`,
